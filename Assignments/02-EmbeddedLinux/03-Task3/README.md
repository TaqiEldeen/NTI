# What is binutils and sysroot in cross compilers

## Binutils

Binutils is a collection of binary tools that are essential for creating and managing executable programs. These tools include assemblers, linkers, and object file manipulation utilities. In a cross-compilation context, binutils are specifically configured to work with a target architecture different from the one on which they are executed. For instance, if you're developing software on a x86_64 architecture but compiling it for an ARM-based embedded device, you would use binutils configured for cross-compilation. These cross-binutils generate object files, link them into executables, and perform other binary-related tasks tailored for the target architecture.

## Sysroot
The sysroot is a directory structure that mimics the root file system of the target platform. It contains libraries, header files, and other essential resources necessary for building software for the target architecture. When cross-compiling software, the compiler needs to find the appropriate headers and libraries for the target platform. The sysroot provides these necessary files. It essentially serves as a self-contained environment for the cross-compiler, enabling it to generate binaries that are compatible with the target platform.
