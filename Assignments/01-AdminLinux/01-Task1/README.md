## a. Remove dir11 with rmdir in one-step. What did you notice? And how did you overcome that?  

```bash

```
You cant remove a non-empty directory wiht rmdir. Therefore use rm -r instead

```bash
rm -r dir11
```


## b. Then remove OldFiles using rmdir â€“p command. State what happened to the hierarchy (Note: you are in your home directory).  
From the user manual:

**-p, --parents**
    remove DIRECTORY and its ancestors; e.g., 'rmdir -p a/b/c' is similar to 'rmdir a/b/c a/b a'

This command cannot delete the Documnets directory as it is not empty!
